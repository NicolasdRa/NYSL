                        <li>COMPETITION FIELDS.<p>Fields used within the competition program must be a minimum of 100x60
                                yards. Leagues, districts or associations participating in the state competition program
                                that are unable to provide a field that meets these minimum requirements must advise the
                                State Competition Board which will assign its Fields Committee to inspect the field and
                                recommend to the Board whether or not a waiver of the minimum dimensions should be
                                granted. Teams from leagues, districts or associations that are unable to provide an
                                acceptable field may be required to play all their games away.</p>

                                <li>U-8 plays on a field 40-50 yards in length and 20-30 yards width.</li>
                                <li>U-10 play on a field 70-80 yards in length and 40-50 yards in width.</li>
